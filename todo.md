- Lab 1 Map Reduce
	- basic idea
		- one coordinator multiple workers on same machine
		- workers communicate with coordinator via RPC
		- workers
			- ask coordinator for task
			- read tasks input from one or more files
			- execute task
			- write task output to one or more files
			- if worker hasn't completed tasks in 10s give task to different worker
	- rules
		- map phase
			- divide intermediate keys into buckets for nReduce reduce tasks
			- each mapper creates nReduce intermediate files for reduce tasks
			- intermediate Map output files in current directory where workers can read them as input to reduce tasks
		- reduce phase
			- output of the X'th reduce tasks in the file mr-out-X
				- this file contains one line per reduce function output
				- watch out for correct format
		- main
			- expects mr/coordinator.go to implement Done() method to return true when MR job completed
			- when job done all workers should exit
	- hints

- Things to think about:
 	- The map part of your worker can use the ihash(key) function (in worker.go) to pick the reduce task for a given key.


- Todo
	- [] ReportComplete implemented in worker and coordinator
	- [] implement coordinator 10s wait for worker to complete else give to other worker
		- [] identification method for worker
		- [] wait method for coordinator
		- [] integration with ReportComplete method
